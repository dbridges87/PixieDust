    <description>The field name to transform from. Fields which hold JSON are always treated like an array of objects, so 0-many records can be created. The only way the Transformation process knows that this is JSON is if the &#39;.&#39; character is included (i.e. Qualification__c.Name instead of just Qualification__c - it knows to transform the Name in JSON from the Qualification__c Field to the target field in the many objects created)</description>

    <inlineHelpText>The field name to transform from. When the from field holds JSON ensure to include the JSON field name. I.e. When creating many qualifications held in a &#39;Qualification__c&#39; field, we might expect to see &#39;Qualification__c.Name&#39;</inlineHelpText>
